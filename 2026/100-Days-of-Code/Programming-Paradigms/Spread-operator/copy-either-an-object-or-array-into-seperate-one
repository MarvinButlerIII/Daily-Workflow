// Copy an object into a completely seperate object using spread operator

const car1 = {
    speed: 200,
    color: 'yellow'
}
const car2 = {...car1};

car1.speed = 201;
console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed); // 201 200

// Copy an array into a completely seperate array, using spread operator

const fruits1 = ['apples', 'pears'];
const fruits2 = [...fruits1];
fruits1.pop();
console.log(fruits1, "not", fruits2); //[ 'apples' ] not [ 'apples', 'pears' ]

//note that the spread operator only performs a shallow copy of the source array or object.
