// Object-oriented programming paradigm approach

var purchase1 = { //functions inside objects are known as methods
    shoes: 100,
    statTax: 1.2,
    totalPrice: function() {
        var calculation = purchase1.shoes * purchase1.statTax;
        console.log('Total price:' , calculation);
    }
}

// Another Object-oriented Programming approach, you can build however objects you need.

var purchase2 = {
    sheos: 50,
    statTax: 1.2,
    totalPrice: function() {
        var calculation = purchase2.shoes * purchase2.stateTax;
        console.log('Total price:' , calculation);
    }
}
//total price method was almost the same in both the purchase1 and purchase2 objects
//this means that you can improve the objects so both methods are identical
//and you can do that by using "this" keyword which you may recall.

// OOP paradigm "this" keyword example

var purchase1 = {
    shoes: 100,
    stateTax: 1.2,
    totalPrice: function() {
        var calculation = this.shoes * this.statTax;
        console.log('Total price;' , calculation);
    }
}
//advantage is to have an alias of "this.keyword" helps not waste resources and remembering names
