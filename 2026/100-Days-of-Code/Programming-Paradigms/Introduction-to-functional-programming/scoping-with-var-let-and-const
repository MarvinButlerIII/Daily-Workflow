// ES6 version of JavaScript

let color = 'red'; //global scope

if (color == 'red') { //block scope Curly Braces
    let color = 'blue'
}
//you can declare two seperate variables with the same name. If one is declared insied curly braces
//and the others is not, you can then only access these variables inside their scope.


// ES5 syntax only example is var

//var user = "Maranda"

//before ES6 the only way to declare a variable was with var.

// ES6 syntax examples are let and const

//let user = "Maranda"

//const user = "Maranda"

// The behavior of let and const is more strict you cannot uee it within your code without it being declared.
// You cannot re-declare using the variable keyword like with using var
// It's scoped into the block even within if statements and loops, like the far or while loops.
