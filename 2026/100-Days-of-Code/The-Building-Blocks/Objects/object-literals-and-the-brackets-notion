// The process of coding the house2 object again, 
// in the same way that I did with the dot notion, 
// only this time, I'll use the brackets notion.

var house2 = {}
house2["rooms"] = 4;

house2["priceUSD"] = 12345;
console.log(house2); // { rooms: 4, color: 'pink', priceUSD: 12345 }

//note that using the brackets notation, I essentially just wrap each property's key as a string, 
// inside either the single or duble quotes jsut like with regular strings.
// then wrap the entire property key into an opening and a closing square bracket.


// I can access and update properties on objects using both also.

var car = {};
car.color = "red";
car ["color"] = "green";
car ["speed"] = 200;
car.speed = 100;
console.log(car); // { color: 'green', speed: 100 }

// With brackets notation, I can add space characters inside property names, like this.

car["number of doors"] = 4;
console.log(car); // { color: 'green', speed: 100, 'number of doors': 4 }

// Additionally, I can add numbers (as the string data type) as property keys.

car["2022"] = 1901;
console.log(car); // { '2022': 1901, color: 'green', speed: 100, 'number of doors': 4 }
//doing this is discouraged, due to obvious reasons of having a property key as a number string not really conveying a lot of useful information.

// Finally, there's one really useful thing that bracket notation has but not available in the dot notion
// It can evaluate expressions

var arrOfKeys = ['speed', 'altitude', 'color'];
var drone = {
    speed: 100,
    altitude: 200,
    color: "red"
}
for (var i = 0; i < arrOfKeys.length; i++) {
    console.log(drone[arrOfKeys[i]]) // 
} /*answer is 100
              200
              red
  */
//this allowed me to loop over each of the values stored inside the drome object, based on each of it propertiea' keys.
