// We can add new key-value pairs to existing objects using the dot notion and the assignment operator

var car = {};
car.color = "red"; // update the value of a property of the car object.

//add a method to the car object so that it can be called as car.turnkey()
car.turnTheKey = function() {
    console.log('engine running');
}

// I will create an object using something known as the constructor function.

var car = {};
car.mileage = 98765;
car.color = "red";
console.log(car);
car.turnTheKey = function() {
    console.log('engine running');

// Now I want to add another method to the car object. I'll name this one 'lightsOn'.

//example of adding propperties and methods to an object
