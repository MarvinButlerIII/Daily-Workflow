Recognize common types of errors in JavaScript

Here are some of the most common errors in JavaScript: 

ReferenceError 

SyntaxError 

TypeError 

RangeError

There are some other errors in JavaScript. These other errors include: 

AggregateError 

Error 

InternalError 

URIError

// ReferenceError example
// attempting to console log a variable that doesn't exist.

console.log(username);

// If variable named 'username' hasn't been declared, 
// the above line of code will result in the following output.

uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined

// Any kind of invalid JavaScript cose will cause a SyntaxError.

var a "there's no assignment operator here";

// The above line of code will throw the following error

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string

//there's an interesting caveat regarding the SyntaxError in JavaScript which is it cannot be caught using try-catch block.

// A TypeError occurs when a mathod is used on a incompatible data type
// Simple example is attempting to run the pop() method on a string.

"hello.pop() // Uncaught TypeError: "hello".pop is not a function

// Converting an everyday Base 10 number (common decimal system) to a Base 2 number (binary number).

(10).toString(2);
// Converts the number 10 into its binary representation: '1010'

//The value of 2 when passed to the toString() method is like saying to JavaScript: convert the value of 10 of the Base 10 number system, to its counterpart in the Base 2 number system.

//JavaScript obliges and translates the regular number 10 to its binary countarpart.

// Besides using Base 2 number system, I can also use the Base 8.

(10).toString(8); // 12

// I get the value 12 back witch is number 10 witten in Base 8.

// Trying to use a imaginary Base number system like Base 100 will throw the RangeError because a non-existing Base 100 system is out of range of the number systems that are availablel to the toString() method

(10).toString(100);
// Uncaught RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36.

// Logical Error Example
// Logical errors cause incorrect behavior in programs despite the absence of syntax or runtime errors.

function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a - b; // Logical error
}
console.log(addNumbers(5, 3));
// Output: 2 (Incorrect, expected: 8)

// Error Object Properties

try {
  let a = b; // ReferenceError
} cathc (error) {
  console.log(error.name); // ReferenceError
  console.log(error.message); // b is not defined
  console.log(error.stack); // Stack trace
}

// Best Practices for Handling Errors Example

funciton divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowd.");
  }
  return a / b;
}

try {
  console.log(divide(5, 0));
} catch (error) {
  console.log.error(error.message); // Division is not allowed
}
